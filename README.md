# Systems Analysis and Design

## 🛠️ Development Methodology


## 👥 Sistemic Analysis
**Focus:** Detailed analysis of the Kaggle competition "Drawing with LLMs"
- Conducted a **systemic analysis** of components, constraints, and objectives
- Identified system limitations (SVG format, computational resources, no internet access)
- Documented competitive foundation and evaluation metrics
- **Document:** [Workshop_1.pdf](./Workshop-1/Workshop_1.pdf)ory contains coursework for the **Systems Analysis and Design** class. Each folder corresponds to a different assignment, project, or topic covered during the course.

### Workshop 1 - Systemic Analysis

**Focus:** Detailed analysis of the Kaggle competition "Drawing with LLMs"
- A **systemic analysis** of the components, restrictions and objectives was performed
- System limitations were identified (SVG, computing resources, no internet access)
- The competitive basis and evaluation metrics were documented
- **Document:** [Workshop_1.pdf](./Workshop-1/Workshop_1.pdf)

### Workshop 2 - Systems Design
**Focus:** Iterative development of system architecture
1. **Initial Design:** Base architecture without evaluation components
2. **Evaluation Integration:** Incorporation of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms
3. **Complete Documentation:** Design decisions, implementation considerations
- **Architectural diagrams** included to visualize the system
- **Document:** [Workshop_2.pdf](./Workshop-2/Workshop_2.pdf)

### Workshop 3 - System Simulation
**Focus:** Practical implementation and simulation of the designed system
- **Complete simulation** with 60 tests performed
- **76.67%** compliance rate on constraints
- Comparison of **3 template versions** (v1, v2, v3)
- Automatic generation of **SVGs, logs, and analysis graphics**
- **Implementation:** Jupyter Notebook with Google Gemini API integration
- **Document:** [Workshop3.pdf](./Workshop_3_Simulation/Workshop3.pdf)

### Final Project
**Focus:** Consolidation and complete academic documentation
- **Scientific paper** with methodology and results
- **Detailed technical report** of development
- **Presentation** and **poster** for academic communication
- **Documents:**
