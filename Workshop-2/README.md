## Development Process

The system design for this workshop was developed through an iterative process:

1. **Initial Architecture Design**: We started by creating a baseline architecture that addressed the core functional requirements of the system without the evaluation components (see `System-WithoutEvaluation.png`).

2. **Evaluation Integration**: After establishing the core architecture, we incorporated evaluation mechanisms to enable performance monitoring, quality assessment, and continuous improvement (see `System-full.png`).

3. **Documentation**: The entire development process, including requirements analysis, design decisions, implementation guidelines, and evaluation strategies, has been documented in the final PDF report.

## Architecture Diagrams

### Basic System Architecture (Without Evaluation)

This diagram illustrates the core system components and their interactions, focusing on the functional aspects of the system without evaluation mechanisms.

### Complete System Architecture (With Evaluation)

The complete architecture includes all system components, including the evaluation modules that enable monitoring, assessment, and continuous improvement of the system.

## Final Documentation

For a comprehensive understanding of the system design, including detailed explanations of each component, design decisions, implementation considerations, and evaluation strategies, please refer to the [Workshop 2 Final Report](./Workshop_2.pdf).

## Key Features

- Modular architecture allowing for easy maintenance and scalability
